# Barakah Analytics Dashboard

FlowFocus offers a unique Barakah Analytics Dashboard to help you reflect on your spiritual and ethical alignment, rather than just productivity metrics.

## What Is Barakah Analytics?

Barakah Analytics tracks how your workflow aligns with spiritual values and intentions. Instead of gamifying performance, it provides gentle, reflective data to support your growth.

## Key Metrics Tracked

- **Niyyah Tracking**: How often you start tasks with a clear intention (niyyah)
- **Prayer Time Alignment**: Frequency of aligning work blocks with prayer times
- **Dhikr Breaks**: How often you pause for remembrance (dhikr)
- **Du'ā Integration**: Use of du'ā before/after tasks
- **Spiritual Reflections**: End-of-day prompts to reflect on your purpose and alignment
- **Ethical Compliance**: How often you review tasks for ethical and spiritual impact

## Daily & Weekly Reflections

- **End-of-Day Reflection**: "Did I seek the approval of Allāh or just productivity?"
- **Weekly Review**: Summaries of your spiritual alignment, intention renewal, and areas for growth
- **Gentle Prompts**: Encouragement to renew intentions and reflect on barakah

## How to Use the Dashboard

1. Access the Barakah Analytics Dashboard from the main menu
2. Review your daily and weekly metrics
3. Reflect on the provided prompts and insights
4. Set new intentions or adjust your workflow for better alignment

## Best Practices

- Use the dashboard as a tool for self-reflection, not self-judgment
- Pair analytics with maqāṣid-based work modes for deeper insight
- Share your reflections with a mentor or accountability partner if desired
- Regularly review your niyyah and barakah metrics to stay spiritually grounded
