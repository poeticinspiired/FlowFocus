# Smart Task & Workflow Management

FlowFocus helps you align your effort with intention, reduce friction, and focus on what truly matters. Our task management system is built on the principles of mercy (raḥmah), purpose (maqṣad), and trust (amānah).

## AI-Prioritized To-Do Lists

Our intelligent task prioritization system goes beyond traditional deadline-based organization:

- **Barakah-Based Prioritization**: Tasks are evaluated based on their spiritual value and worldly impact
- **Urgency Assessment**: AI analyzes task deadlines, dependencies, and impact
- **Value Alignment**: Tasks are weighted according to your personal and spiritual goals
- **Smart Filtering**: View tasks through different lenses (prayer times, energy levels, context)

## Smart Workflows & Automations

Preserve your willpower and minimize decision fatigue with intelligent automation:

- **Custom Workflow Templates**: Create and save workflow patterns for recurring tasks
- **Context-Aware Automation**: Tasks automatically adjust based on your location, time, and energy
- **Smart Task Grouping**: Related tasks are intelligently grouped for efficient completion
- **Automated Task Transitions**: Smooth handoffs between different stages of work

## Customizable Productivity Templates

Choose from a variety of task structures designed for different cognitive styles:

- **Neurodivergent-Friendly Templates**: Structures that support various processing styles
- **Prayer-Rhythm Templates**: Task organization aligned with daily prayer times
- **Energy-Based Templates**: Task grouping based on energy requirements
- **Context-Specific Templates**: Templates for different environments (home, work, study)
