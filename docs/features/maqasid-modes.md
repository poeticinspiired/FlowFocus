# Maqāṣid-Based Work Modes

FlowFocus offers unique work modes inspired by the higher objectives (maqāṣid) of the Sharī‘ah: preservation of dīn (faith), life, intellect, wealth, and lineage. These modes help you align your productivity with spiritual and ethical intentions.

## What Are Maqāṣid-Based Work Modes?

Each mode subtly changes interface cues, priority prompts, and soundscapes to support your chosen spiritual intention. Modes include:

- **‘Ibādah Mode**: For acts of worship and devotion. Calms the interface, highlights dhikr, and integrates Qur'an recitation.
- **‘Ilm Mode**: For seeking knowledge. Activates study-friendly layouts, focus soundscapes, and du'ā for learning.
- **Khidmah Mode**: For service and helping others. Emphasizes community, gratitude, and reminders of intention.
- **Rizq Mode**: For work and earning. Encourages ethical reflection, barakah prompts, and du'ā for sustenance.
- **Family Mode**: For time with family and loved ones. Reduces digital noise, increases reminders for presence and gratitude.

## How It Works

- **Interface Cues**: Colors, icons, and layouts adapt to the selected mode.
- **Priority Prompts**: Task suggestions and reminders are filtered through the lens of your chosen maqṣad.
- **Soundscapes**: Background sounds and adhkār are tailored to the mode.
- **Barakah Analytics**: Track how your time and tasks align with your spiritual objectives.
